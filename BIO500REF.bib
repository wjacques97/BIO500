	abstract = {Background
              Student mental health in higher education has been an increasing concern. The {COVID}-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus.
            
            
              Objective
              Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the {COVID}-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods.
            
            
              Results
              Of the 195 students, 138 (71\%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the {COVID}-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91\% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89\%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86\%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86\%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82\%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the {COVID}-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students.},

	abstract = {Applying three mathematical modeling techniques, this study proposes and tests the ﬁt of an academic performance model, and then estimates the relative importance of four performance predictors: academic ability, performance goal orientation, educational technology use, and social network density. Drawing on social network theory, ﬁndings from this study show that social network density is a statistically important and unique predictor of academic performance, suggesting that “who you know” matters in large classroom settings. However, this study also indicates that academic ability is the most dominant factor in the explanation of academic performance. Practical and theoretical implications for enhancing academic performance through social networks are discussed.},
